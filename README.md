# __Photographer Sussi Thunell__

My project is to deliver an actual webpage to my client and sister-in-law who is a very talented hobby photographer. To have the world discover her talents and book her for jobs.

# UX

Susanne want to communicate with prospective clients the what, the how and when of her business. A part she feels takes time from the actual photoshooting.
Susanne aims to use the webpage as a means to communicate with visitors and clients by showcasing her work, as well as having ready-to-order services with prices already set. 

As visitor it will be easier to define what service to inquiry about, what the cost of the photo shoot will be and any extra costs depending on preferences, framing, photocopies etc..
A central part of the webpage is to link together the different platforms that Susanne utilizes for her communication with users on Facebook and Instagram.

# Features
The home page is meant to be inviting and have a clear message
Services page describes features/services rendered.
Gallery page to portrait images.
Contact page, to make contact with the photographer, to make an inquiry.


## Features Left to Implement
Home/Index page. I want to implement a zoom effect on the hero image.
The Services page will have a selection of prices for specific services.
The gallery page will have pages and a scroll function inside an modal..
The contact form will have an calender showing the available timed that the photographer is available.
Footer: will hanve links to social platforms (Facebook, Instagram)

# Technologies Used

For Mockups, Balsamiq was used.
CSS styling was used by utilizing Bootstrap framework. The code snippets have been implemented from [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com).

# Testing
I have tested my code with the following validators:
[HTML Validator, w3](https://validator.w3.org/)
[CSS Validator, Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I have had issues with responsiveness, due to bad use of bootstrap code... I will continue to work out the issues, to make the webpage fully responsive, since most vitors and prospective clients in Sweden use ther cell phone today.

The Gallery page, I had problems with my columns and displaying images properly. I have sample images uploades in github but have to implement the featur of thumbnailing images in colums and opening them up in a modal with scroll function (arrows).

# Deployment
I am using Github pages to deploy the webpage.
